# Async Learning Project

## Introduction

This project is dedicated to understanding asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio` and `await`. By the end of this project, you'll have a comprehensive understanding of various asynchronous programming concepts without needing to consult external resources. This repository contains all the necessary scripts and documentation to demonstrate the use of async programming techniques in Python.

## Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain the following topics clearly:

- **Async and Await Syntax**: Understand how to define and use asynchronous functions using `async` and `await` keywords.
- **Execution of an Async Program**: Learn how to run an async program with the `asyncio` module.
- **Concurrent Coroutines**: Grasp how to manage and run concurrent coroutines to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
- **Creation of asyncio Tasks**: Learn how to create asyncio tasks to schedule the execution of coroutines.
- **Usage of the Random Module**: Understand how to incorporate randomness in your asynchronous programs using Python's `random` module.


## Setup and Execution

To run any of the scripts in this repository, you can follow these steps:

1. Ensure you are using Ubuntu 18.04 LTS with Python 3.7 installed.
2. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/R-HYTE/alx-backend-python.git
   ```
3. **Change directory to the project folder:**
   ```bash
   cd 0x01-python_async_function
   ```
4. **Make the python script executable:**
   ```bash
   chmod +x filename.py
   ```
5. **Execute the script:**
   ```bash
   ./filename.py
   ```

## Conclusion

This project serves as a stepping stone into the world of asynchronous programming in Python.
